## ✅ Your Setup is Complete!

I've successfully integrated Porcupine wake word detection with your access key!

**Wake Word:** "JARVIS"
**Status:** ✅ Ready to use

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Enter Your Access Key
1. Run the app: `flutter run`
2. Tap Settings (⚙️ icon)
3. Scroll to "Porcupine Wake Word" section
4. Paste your access key: `CExlRfk8z/A47D8rP/Bz3ScHoDmiRaslMfLJjiYkdpf0S04QSt4wYQ==`
5. Tap "Save Settings"

### Step 2: Add Emergency Contacts
1. Go back to home screen
2. Tap + button
3. Add at least one emergency contact
4. Give it a wake word (e.g., "police")

### Step 3: Test It!
1. Say: **"Jarvis"** (the Porcupine wake word)
2. App will activate and start listening
3. Then say: **"help emergency police"**
4. Countdown screen appears!

## 🎤 How It Works

**Two-Stage Detection:**

1. **Stage 1 - Porcupine (Always On)**
   - Listens for: "Jarvis"
   - Low power consumption
   - Works in background (limited)
   - Offline processing

2. **Stage 2 - Speech Recognition (On Demand)**
   - Activates after "Jarvis" is detected
   - Listens for: "help emergency [wake word]"
   - Matches your emergency contacts
   - Triggers countdown

## 📝 Usage Examples

**Full Command:**
```
You: "Jarvis"
App: (activates listening)
You: "help emergency police"
App: (starts countdown to call police)
```

**Alternative:**
```
You: "Jarvis"
App: (activates listening)
You: "help emergency ambulance"
App: (starts countdown to call ambulance)
```

## ⚙️ Settings Options

In the Settings screen:

**Countdown Timer:**
- 30 seconds or 60 seconds

**Listening Options:**
- ✅ **Auto-Start Listening** - Starts speech recognition automatically
- ✅ **Keep Screen On** - Prevents screen sleep

**Porcupine Wake Word:**
- 🔑 **Access Key** - Your Picovoice access key (paste here)
- Built-in wake word: "Jarvis"

## 🔋 Battery & Performance

**Porcupine (Always-On):**
- 🔋 Low power (optimized for always-on)
- 🎯 High accuracy
- 📶 Works offline
- ⏱️ Instant response

**Speech Recognition (On-Demand):**
- 🔋🔋 Medium power (only active after "Jarvis")
- 🎯 Good accuracy
- 📶 May need internet
- ⏱️ Processes commands

## 🎯 Current Limitations

**What Works:**
- ✅ "Jarvis" detection while app is open
- ✅ Emergency command after wake word
- ✅ Offline wake word detection
- ✅ Low battery usage

**OS Restrictions:**
- ⚠️ App must be in foreground for best results
- ⚠️ Background works for limited time only
- ⚠️ Phone should be unlocked
- ⚠️ iOS/Android limit background audio

**Why:** System security, privacy, and battery management

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Say "Jarvis" Clearly**
   - Normal speaking volume
   - Clear pronunciation: "JAR-vis"
   - Wait for app to activate

2. **Then Say Emergency Command**
   - "help emergency [your contact's wake word]"
   - Be clear and calm
   - One command at a time

3. **Keep App Accessible**
   - Leave app open on home screen
   - Or keep it easily accessible
   - Enable "Keep Screen On" for continuous use

4. **Test First!**
   - Use non-emergency number for testing
   - Practice the two-step command
   - Verify countdown works

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Jarvis" Not Detected:**
- ✅ Check access key is entered in Settings
- ✅ Speak clearly and at normal volume
- ✅ Make sure app is open
- ✅ Check microphone permissions

**Emergency Command Not Working:**
- ✅ Wait for "Jarvis" detection first
- ✅ Say "help emergency" + wake word
- ✅ Check contact wake words match
- ✅ Speak clearly without background noise

**App Stops Listening:**
- ✅ OS may pause background app
- ✅ Keep app in foreground
- ✅ Reopen app to restart
- ✅ Enable "Auto-Start Listening"
