# Lock Screen Emergency Access Guide

## The Challenge
iOS security prevents third-party apps from continuously listening on the lock screen for battery and privacy reasons. Only Siri has this capability.

## ‚úÖ WHAT I'VE IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Background Audio Mode (Active Now)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Enabled in Info.plist
- **What it does**: Keeps the app listening when screen is OFF but app is OPEN
- **How to use**:
  1. Open the Emergency App
  2. Let it start listening (automatic)
  3. Lock your iPhone (press side button)
  4. App continues listening with screen off
  5. Say "help emergency [wakeword]"
  6. Screen wakes, countdown starts, call initiates

- **Limitations**: 
  - App must be actively running (not closed or suspended)
  - After ~30-60 min, iOS may suspend the app to save battery
  - If you open another app, this app goes to background and stops listening

### 2. Keep Screen On Mode
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Enabled by default
- **What it does**: Screen stays on while app is active
- **Best for**: Keeping app visible and always listening
- **Battery impact**: Higher, but ensures continuous operation

## üéØ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOWS FOR EMERGENCIES

### Option A: Always-Ready Mode (Current Implementation)
**Best for: Home, office, or when you can keep app open**

1. Open Emergency App
2. Place phone face-down on table (screen dims but app stays active)
3. App listens 24/7 while open
4. Voice command works even when screen is dim/locked

**Pros**: 
- True hands-free operation
- Works with screen off
- Fast response time

**Cons**: 
- Higher battery usage
- App must stay in foreground

### Option B: Lock Screen Quick Launch
**Best for: On-the-go emergency access**

Setup:
1. Settings ‚Üí Face ID & Passcode ‚Üí "Control Center" ‚Üí Enable on Lock Screen
2. iPhone ‚Üí Control Center ‚Üí Add "Shortcuts" widget
3. Create shortcut to open Emergency App

Usage:
1. From lock screen, swipe down for Control Center
2. Tap Emergency App shortcut
3. App opens and starts listening immediately
4. Say your voice command

**Pros**:
- One tap from lock screen
- No need to keep app open
- Better battery life

**Cons**:
- Requires one touch to activate

### Option C: Siri Shortcut Integration (Recommended Addition)
**Best for: Complete hands-free from lock screen**

Setup:
1. Settings ‚Üí Siri & Search ‚Üí "Emergency App" ‚Üí Add to Siri
2. Record phrase: "Emergency police" (or your wake word)

Usage:
1. Say: "Hey Siri, emergency police"
2. Siri triggers your app
3. App opens and starts countdown/call

**Pros**:
- Works on lock screen
- Completely hands-free
- Uses built-in Siri wake word detection

**Cons**:
- Requires "Hey Siri" prefix
- Need to set up for each contact type

## üì± iOS TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS

### What's NOT Possible on iOS:
‚ùå Third-party wake word detection on locked screen
‚ùå Continuous background listening when app is closed
‚ùå Bypassing iOS security to auto-unlock

### What IS Possible:
‚úÖ Keep listening while app is open (screen can be off)
‚úÖ Quick launch from lock screen
‚úÖ Siri Shortcuts for voice activation
‚úÖ Background audio mode for extended listening

## üîã BATTERY CONSIDERATIONS

**Current Setup (Always Listening)**:
- Battery drain: ~15-25% per hour (depending on usage)
- Recommendation: Keep phone plugged in when using at home/office

**To Reduce Battery Usage**:
1. Turn off "Keep Screen On" in Settings
2. Use "Quick Launch" method instead of always-listening
3. Close app when not needed

## üöÄ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (If Needed)

### 1. Apple Watch Integration
- Wake word detection on watch
- Triggers phone app
- Works when phone is locked

### 2. Live Activity Widget
- Lock screen widget showing "Listening" status
- Quick tap to trigger emergency call
- iOS 16+ only

### 3. Focus Mode Integration
- "Emergency Mode" that keeps app active
- Prevents other apps from suspending it
- Customizable per-situation

## üí° BEST PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS

**For Home/Office Use**:
```
‚úÖ Keep app open
‚úÖ Screen off (locked) but app active
‚úÖ Phone plugged in
‚úÖ Voice commands work hands-free
```

**For On-the-Go**:
```
‚úÖ Use Siri Shortcuts: "Hey Siri, emergency police"
‚úÖ Or use Control Center quick launch
‚úÖ App starts listening immediately
```

**For Maximum Emergency Readiness**:
```
‚úÖ Keep app open and phone plugged in
‚úÖ "Keep Screen On" enabled
‚úÖ Siri Shortcuts configured as backup
‚úÖ Control Center shortcut ready
```

## üìã TESTING YOUR SETUP

1. **Test Always-Listening Mode**:
   - Open app ‚Üí Lock screen ‚Üí Say "help emergency [wakeword]"
   - Should work with screen off

2. **Test Siri Shortcut** (if configured):
   - Lock screen ‚Üí "Hey Siri, emergency police"
   - Should open app and start countdown

3. **Test Quick Launch**:
   - Lock screen ‚Üí Control Center ‚Üí Tap Emergency App
   - Should open to listening mode

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

- iOS will always show a confirmation dialog before making a phone call (security feature)
- Background listening works best when phone is stationary (not moving/in pocket)
- App may need manual restart after phone reboot
- Ensure "Low Power Mode" is OFF for best performance

---

**Current Status**: Your app now has background audio mode enabled, which allows listening with screen locked (as long as app is open). This is the best third-party apps can achieve on iOS without Siri integration.

**Next Step**: Would you like me to implement Siri Shortcuts integration for true lock-screen hands-free operation?
