## 🆘 FAQ

**Q: Can the app work like "Hey Siri" right now?**
A: Not exactly. With Porcupine (after getting access key), it's close! But iOS/Android limit background apps for battery life.

**Q: Do I need to pay for Porcupine?**
A: No! Free tier is perfect for personal use. Paid license only needed for commercial deployment.

**Q: Will auto-start listening drain my battery?**
A: Yes, some battery usage. But "Keep Screen On" uses more. Turn off when not needed.

**Q: Can I use my own custom wake word?**
A: Yes! With Porcupine, you can train "help emergency" as your wake word at Picovoice Console.

**Q: Which option should I use?**
A: Start with auto-start listening (works now). Add Porcupine later if you want always-on detection.

**Q: Can it detect wake words when phone is locked?**
A: Not reliably. iOS/Android limit this for security and battery reasons. Best to keep app open.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **For Maximum Reliability**:
   - Keep app open and visible
   - Enable auto-start + keep screen on
   - Place phone in easy-to-reach spot
   - Use clear, simple wake words

2. **For Better Battery Life**:
   - Don't enable "Keep Screen On"
   - Manually start listening when needed
   - Close app when not in use

3. **For Future Porcupine Setup**:
   - Use built-in wake words first ("jarvis", "alexa")
   - Test thoroughly before using custom wake words
   - Check battery usage in phone settings
